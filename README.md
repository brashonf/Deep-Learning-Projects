# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict taxi fares in New York City using deep learning techniques. It's based on a Kaggle competition dataset containing over 55 million taxi rides.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- pickup_datetime: Timestamp of the ride start
- pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude: Coordinates of the pickup location
- dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude: Coordinates of the dropoff location
- passenger_count: Number of passengers

Target variable: fare_amount (USD)

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting time-based features, calculating distances)
   - Normalization of numerical features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualization of fare distributions, popular routes, time-based patterns

3. Model Development:
   - Built a deep neural network using TensorFlow
   - Architecture: [Brief description of your model architecture]
   - Hyperparameter tuning using Random Forest Regressor

4. Evaluation:
   - Metrics used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Cross-validation strategy: 

## Results
- Achieved a Mean Absolute Error of $X.XX on the test set
- [Any other notable results or insights]

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation

## Setup and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-taxi-fare-prediction.git
cd nyc-taxi-fare-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
